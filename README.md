# ‚ö° JavaScript Course  

## üìñ Course, Exercises and Project Description  
This repository is composed of three parts:

1. **JavaScript Course**:  
   In the **`course/`** folder, you will find my personal notes on the basic and practical concepts of JavaScript that I learned in the **SergieCode** course. This course provides the fundamental knowledge needed to understand and practice JavaScript, including code examples, logic exercises, and detailed explanations about programming concepts, functions, and DOM manipulation.

2. **JavaScript Exercises**:  
   In the **`exercises/`** folder, there are different small practices developed to reinforce the main concepts of JavaScript. These exercises were used as training to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve logic, and become familiar with the language‚Äôs syntax through hands-on application.

3. **JavaScript Projects**:  
   In the **`project/`** folder, I developed six projects inspired by the examples shown in the **SergieCode** course, but with expanded approaches and custom adjustments. Among them are a **calculator** with basic operations, a **number guessing game** where the program provides hints until the correct answer is found, and a **dynamic navigation page** that loads content with `appendChild` from an external data file. Additionally, I created a **weather application** that retrieves real-time conditions from an API, a **registration form** with validation and integration to Firebase, and finally, a **movie search engine** that queries an external API to display results with images and details. Each project was designed to consolidate the knowledge acquired, improve logical thinking, and demonstrate practical applications of JavaScript in real-world scenarios.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Use of Non-Owned Content  
In all parts of this repository (course, exercises, and projects), **multimedia resources** (such as images, icons, or sample data) that are not my own work have been used. These resources belong to their respective creators and companies. They are used exclusively for educational purposes, within the context of the course and projects, and **are not for commercial use**. All copyright over the visual, audio, and video content belongs to the respective original creators.

### üîë Educational Purpose  
The main goal of this repository is to learn and practice JavaScript, as well as to apply programming logic and interactivity in web development. Any multimedia resources used in the projects are **purely educational** and **non-commercial**. Throughout the development of these projects, I have implemented **my own work**, such as detailed comments in the code, validations, and additional improvements to strengthen the learning process.

## üíº Project Structure  

### üìÇ Folders  
- **`course/`**: Contains all the notes and examples related to the basic and practical concepts of JavaScript that I learned in the **SergieCode** course.  

- **`exercises/`**: Contains small practices and exercises designed to reinforce the course‚Äôs main concepts.  

- **`projects/`**: Contains six projects developed as a practical application of the knowledge acquired during the course. Each one demonstrates a specific area of JavaScript, from DOM manipulation to API integration and form validation.

üí° *This README outlines the structure and purpose of the repository to facilitate its understanding and maintenance. The course, exercises, and projects are practical examples designed to learn and demonstrate the use of JavaScript.*

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important  
The **code** in this repository is **my own work**, written and adapted by me during the course, exercises, and project development. The only elements that do not belong to me are the multimedia resources (images, icons, data samples, etc.), which have been used exclusively for educational purposes, always respecting the copyright of the original creators.  

- The **course** includes examples and resources taken for educational purposes, respecting the copyright of the original creators.  
- The **JavaScript projects** and **exercises** were created with the same purpose: to practice what I learned in the **SergieCode** course. All multimedia resources used are owned by their respective authors and companies and are used for educational purposes, respecting the copyright.

üíª *These projects, exercises, and course were made for educational purposes, based on the **SergieCode** course, and with the goal of learning and practicing JavaScript.*  

## üèÜ Acknowledgments and Mentions  
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to teacher `¬©SergieCode` for his invaluable contribution to my learning in the JavaScript course. Thanks to his clear explanations, practical approach, and generosity in sharing his knowledge, this project has become possible. His dedication and effort have been essential to expanding my horizons and taking my learning to a higher level. I deeply thank him for being such an inspiring and committed instructor.

I also want to extend my deepest recognition to the creators of the multimedia resources used in these projects. The **visual**, **audio**, and **data** content belongs to their respective authors and companies, and without their material, this project would not have been able to reach the quality and clarity it presents today. I am very grateful for the work and dedication they have put into creating these resources. I apologize for any inconvenience, and with the utmost respect, I thank them for allowing us to access them for educational purposes. I have made sure to select the highest-quality resources to honor their efforts and dedication.

## üó£Ô∏è Project Language  
All the content in this repository, both in the **projects**, **exercises**, and the **course**, is in **Spanish**. I have chosen to keep the content in this language because it is a **personal** project, and it is easier for me to understand and organize the information in Spanish. This choice has allowed me to work more efficiently and in greater detail in the comments and code structure. **Only the repository description and this README will be in English**, to ensure that it is accessible to a wider audience, while maintaining a clear and understandable educational focus.
